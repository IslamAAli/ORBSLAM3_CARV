# SLAM_CARV
newer version of SLAM and CARV engine

# Personal Notes (To Edit)
Export command 
```
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:~/vr_ws/SLAM_CARV/Examples/ROS
```

# Differences from original repo
1. Working with c++14
2. removed build folders being in git repo for cleaner build.
3. Applied some fixes to the code from the original ORB-SLAM2
4. suppress all warnings so that we can only see errors and not warnings from deprecation in eigen.
5. Make a ```config_files``` directory, that has all yaml files and configuration files.
6. Change ```crono::monotonic_clock``` to ```chrono::steady_clock```

# Compilation Edits
1. Install ros melodic (Tutorial [Here](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu]) )
2. Install ORB-SLAM2 dependencies
3. Install CGAL ``` sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev ```
4. Edit from original repo [Here](https://github.com/atlas-jj/ORB-SLAM-free-space-carving/tree/master)
   - Move the code to work with c++14 in order to avoid the error of not having proper access to ```std::decay_t```
5. change permission for build file of ORB-SLAM2 ```chmod +x ./build.sh```
6. build ORB-SLAM2 ```./build.sh```
7. change permission for build file of ROS modules ```chmod +x ./build_ros.sh```
8. build ros modules ```./build_ros.sh```

# Steps to run
1. Build the docker file using the build script
 ```
 $ cd Docker
 $ sudo ./build.sh
 ```
2. Now you should be able to run the docker image with VNC capabilities (make sure that the device id in the ./run.sh script is correct .. device0 should work with webcams.
```
$ sudo ./run.sh
```
3. In any VNC viewer (Remmina for example) use the following vnc url
```
localhost:5900
```
4. You will be prompted for a password, use the "password" (yes, very secure I guess).
5. At this point, you have a full ubuntu desktop to work with.
6. right click anywhere, and open
```
Application >> Shells >> Bash
```
7. We need to run a camera node to publish this to ros and then do the mapping to our CARV, so, we can just launch the camera test module from ros to start publishing
```
$ roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
```
8. You should see the camera feed in a window.
9. Now, let's run CARV, open another shell terminal and do the following (it is now using ORB-SLAM3)
```
Applications >> shells >> Bash
$ cd root/CARV/ORBSLAM3_CARV
$ rosrun ORB_CARV_Pub Mono Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Logitech_c270_HD720p.yaml /camera/image_raw:=/usb_cam/image_raw
```
10. ORB-SLAM2 will load the vocabulary dictionary for DBoW and then you should see that the SLAM window and SLAM image feed is working.
